## MUSE EEG v.18.05.07  
###### Inspired by Brenda de Wit
###### Written by Brad Kennedy, Tyler Collins, and Mike Cichonski
###### For the Brock University Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory (BUCANL) 
###### Under the supervision of Dr. Sidney Segalowitz, PhD
___________________________________________________________

### Requirements
* Python 2.7 (Python 3 should also work)
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * psychopy

### Installation Instructions
#### Linux/MacOS (Recommended)
##### Assuming there is already a default native version of Python on these operating systems with most of the packages required to run this code, there is very little involved in getting MUSE_EEG downloaded and installed on Linux or MacOS:
1. Make sure you open the BASH "terminal" app
2. Navigate to a desired directory where you'd like MUSE_EEG downloaded and installed (using 'ls' to check all files and folders within your current directory, and using 'cd' to navigate to a new directory). There are many tutorials online for navigating through a BASH terminal, so we won't go into more detail here. [[References available soon!]]
3. Once you've navigated to the desired directory, you can clone (download) the MUSE_EEG repository from github into that directory. Everything you need will be in that directory.
4. (Optional) You may choose to rename the MUSE_EEG folder to something more meaningful (project/study name) if you wish.
#### Windows 7/8/10 (Use at your own risk)
##### There will be more iformation here about installingon Windows, but it should be a very similar process as Linux or MacOS if the GitBash application is used as your terminal [[More testing to come!]]
1. There will be some steps here soon
2. Don't worry...
3. And, whatever you do, don't panic!

### Usage Instructions 
#### Linux/MacOS
1. In terminal, run `python study_run.py` to begin the study 
2. There will be more...
3. And even more...
4. But not too much :)

### Scripts

**INPUT:**
Run the current study
**OUTPUT:**
Lots of data!

#### scripts/acquire.py

**INPUT:**
Acquire the brain data
**OUTPUT:** 
* Someone should fill this out at some point
* This is it for now...

#### scripts/task_skelleton.py

**INPUT:**
This is the file that defines the task
This file can potentially be changed to fit different paradigms
**OUTPUT:**
* Presents the task of the screen

* matplotlib
* psychopy

#### Installation Instructions
<br>
##### Linux/MacOS (Recommended)
<br>
###### Assuming there is already a built in version of Python ###### with most of the required packages wil will be using, ###### there is very little involved in getting MUSE_EEG 
###### downloaded and installed on Linux or MacOS:
1. Make sure you open the "Terminal" app
2. Navigate to a desired directory where you'd like MUSE_EEG downloaded and installed (using 'ls' to check all files and folders within your current directory, and using 'cd' to navigate to a new directory). There are many tutorials online for navigating through a BASH terminal, so we won't go into more detail here. [[References available soon!]]
3. Once you've navigated to the desired directory, you can clone (download) the MUSE_EEG repository from github into that directory. Everything you need will be in that directory.
<br>
##### Windows 7/8/10 (Use at your own risk)
